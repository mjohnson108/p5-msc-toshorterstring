Math::Symbolic::Custom::ToShorterString
=======================================

Provides "to_shorter_infix_string()" through the Math::Symbolic module extension class. "to_shorter_infix_string()" attempts to provide a string representation of a Math::Symbolic tree that is shorter than the existing (infix) "to_string()" method. 

The "to_string()" method wraps every branch in parentheses/brackets, which makes larger expressions difficult to read. "to_shorter_infix_string()" tries to determine whether parentheses are required and omits them. One of the goals of this module is that the output string should parse to a Math::Symbolic tree that is (at least numerically) equivalent to the original expression - even if the resulting Math::Symbolic tree might not be completely identical to the original (for that, use "to_string()"). Where appropriate, it produces strings containing the Math::Symbolic parser aliases "sqrt()" and "exp()".

The "to_shorter_infix_string()" does not replace the "to_string()" method, it has to be called explicitly. E.g.:-

use Math::Symbolic qw(:all);
use Math::Symbolic::Custom::ToShorterString;

my $f = parse_from_string("1*2+3*4+5*sqrt(x+y+z)");
print "to_string():\t", $f->to_string(), "\n";
# to_string():	((1 * 2) + (3 * 4)) + (5 * (((x + y) + z) ^ 0.5))
print "to_shorter_infix_string():\t", $f->to_shorter_infix_string(), "\n";
# to_shorter_infix_string():	(1*2 + 3*4) + (5*sqrt(x + y + z))

TODO

Still very early, needs more work on detecting if the brackets are necessary for the sub-expression.
